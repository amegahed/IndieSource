	<h2><i class="fa fa-gears"></i>The License</h2>

	<p>The <%= application.name %> is like OpenSource but with two restrictions: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>It restricts the very largest companies from using or deploying the software.</li>
		<li>It restricts the software from being hosted by the three largest cloud hosting monopolies. </li>
	</ol>

	<br />

	<p>To use the <a href="#license"><%= application.name %> License</a>, simply include the following text in your source code distribution.  It may be downloaded as a text or markdown files:

	<p>Text: <a href="downloads/LICENSE.txt">LICENSE.txt</a></p>
	<p>Markdown: <a href="downloads/LICENSE.md">LICENSE.md</a></p>

	<h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>How Does It Compare To Other Licenses?</h2>

	<p>First of all, to be clear, <%= application.name %> is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> as it is strictly defined by the <a href="https://opensource.org">OSI</a>.  Because of the limitations that it places upon the use of the software, it does not conform to the Open Source definition. </p>

	<p><%= application.name %> can best be described as a member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">Source Available</a> family of licenses, which make the source code available to all users but places some restrictions upon the use of the software. The restrictions make this license similar in spirit to the <a href="https://fair.io">Fair Source</a> licenses or to the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/licenses/small-business/1.0.0">PolyForm Small Business License</a> but the <%= application.name %> license is more specific in terms of the particular restrictions. </p>
