	<p>There are already a plethora of software licenses that a prospective cloud software developer and user must sort through.  Why on earth would we want to add another one to the mix? </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-door-open"></i>Problems with Open Source</h2>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">Open Source</a> licenses may be good for the code, but they are bad for the individual / developer.  Open Source licenses (as strictly defined by the <a href="https://opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a>) require that the developer give up all rights to their work, which the tech giants proceed to monetize using their monopoly platforms and brands. By giving up their rights, developers are also giving up the possibilty of competing with the tech giants. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-door-closed"></i>Problems with Closed Source</h2>
				<p>The problems associated with Closed Source licenses are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">well documented</a>.  By keeping access to the source code closed, bugs remain hidden.  Since closed, proprietary software often requires  steep licensing fees, it tends to hurt the small, individual software user more than large corporate users who can more easily amortize and pass along the licensing costs.  Also, Closed Source software does not allow for the code to be expanded upon and for the ideas expressed in the code to proliferate and grow. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i>Problems with Ethical Source</h2>
				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Ethical_Source" target="_blank">Ethical Source</a> licenses are an attempt to address some of the shortcomings of the Open and Closed sourced licenses by stipulating how the software may be used.  The problem is that Ethical Source licenses are too vague. They tend to embrace ideas such as racial equity and environmental sustainability, which, while worthwhile goals, are not possible to define or enforce. So, while well-meaning, these licenses lack the specifics that would be required to make them legally binding. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-handshake"></i>Problems with Fair Source</h2>
				<p><a href="https://fair.io" target="_blank">Fair Source</a> licenses probably come the closest in spirit to the <%= application.name %> license by attempting to look out for the needs of the humans who develop and use the software. These licenses tend to allow individual use of the software but require a negotiation between the developer and the user for substantial commercial use.  Unfortunately, the tech community tends to find these restrictions too onerous and therefore tends to look down upon these licenses.  By stipulating a very small and specific set of restrictions, the <%= application.name %> license aims to overcome these objections. </p>
