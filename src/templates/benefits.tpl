				<p>Don't get "Amazoned".  Tech giants like Amazon are famous for taking open source technology, slapping their own brand on it, and then deploying it as their own service which nobody can compete with, including the inventors. The <%= application.name %> license can help to prevent this from happening to you. </p>
