				<h2><i class="fa fa-building"></i>Discourage Monopolies</h2>
				<p>Consolidation has been rampant across all sectors of the economy. The tech monopolies now have powers that were once only attributable to (and sometimes surpass those of) governments. This degree of concentration of power inevitably leads to abuse. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>Battle Econonic Inequality</h2>
				<p>We are unquestionably living in a second <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States">Gilded Age"</a>. At the apex of this pyramid are the tech giant corporations, several of which now have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization">multi-trillion dollar valuations</a>.  In our winner-take-all economy, let's stop automatically favoring these corporations by default. </p>

				<p>While there are exceptions, large corporations do not generally become dominant by playing nice.  The corporations that are specifically targeted by the <%= application.name %> license are guilty of a number of abusive behaviors including abuse of employees, abuse of their dominant position in the marketplace, and abuse of customers. </p>

				<p>We now live in an age where much of our communications in surveilled either by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">corporate interests</a> or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">the government</a>.  Currently, most of our communications go through a few very large companies. Let's work towards restoring a more de-centralized and more private Internet once again. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-dollar"></i>Encourage Capitalism</h2>
				<p>Although these monopolist companies came to power through the capitalist system, that system is no longer functioning.  Today, new companies offering superior products and services at lower costs find it impossible to compete with the entrenched giants. This is a post-capitalist system. </p>

				<h2><i class="fa fa-brain"></i>Increase Innovation</h2>
				<p>Despite the popular notion that the market will continually surface new winners, the largest companies in technology have remained relatively stable for decades. This is by design.  The top priority of the top tech companies is to retain their dominance, which means suppressing potential future competitors. This leads to stagnation and loss of opportunity. </p>
